      "\t<FullText>Rumors Make Merrill Lynch Most Active                 Wall Street's rumor mill percolated yesterday with talk that the No 3 automaker Chrysler Corp might be preparing takeover of Merrill Lynch Co the nation s largest brokerage                 Apparently as result Merrill Lynch led the active list on the New York Stock Exchange with the price of share up 1% at 36%. Stock prices in general declined slightly as hopes for an early resumption of the mar ket s 1985 rally went unfulfilled The Dow Jones average of 30 indus trials slipped 1.61 to 1,547.59. Volume on the New York exchange came to 99.61 million shares Both Merrill Lynch and Chrysler denied that anything was in the works and auto analysts also were skeptical It's true that Chrysler will have substantial amount of cash flow this year and next said Joseph Phillippi of Hutton Co But their strategy is to husband some of that cash until the next downturn for Vr tVt L'i-W                 autos which they expect to happen at least once between now and the end of the decade Prudential-Bache auto analyst Thomas Lent said Merrill Lynch takeover would involve at least billion to billion Chrysler has made it known on several occasions that it is out to diversify further Lent said guess they would look at fi nancial services company at the right price But that right price would have to be on much smaller company Buying Merrill Lynch is just not in Chrysler's long-term interest Among other financial services stocks PaineWebber gained to 35; Hutton to 3514, and Phibro-Sa- lomon 14 to 44%. Many Wall Streeters have been hop ing for pickup in activity with the market back on normal schedule after two weeks broken up by the Christmas and New Year's holidays But the pace remained sluggish The dollar meanwhile flirted with historic high against its Cana dian counterpart The Canadian dol lar s weakness led the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Toronto-Dominion Bank to raise their prime lending rates to 10.5 percent from 10 percent Douglas Peters Toronto- Do minion s yt ' TCr 'r j-'Vi' V1 'i                 chief economist said the exchange cri sis had been precipitated by short- term speculative binge Yesterday one dollar would buy 4053 Canadian down from 4066 Friday In Europe the dollar declined mar against the British pound In late trading it cost 4375 to buy one pound compared with the 4370 it cost Friday In Tokyo the dollar was up against the Japanese yen closing at 202.30 yen compared with 200.60 on the last day of 1985.

board room recognize this as the                 protest of the organization man But no even in corporate defeat Dave DeBusschere would play by their rules His reaction was businesslike if trifle unconventional The fired em ployee called news conference And not just anywhere but in private room of that bastion of the New York power lunch the Four Seasons So much for those who claimed that as an executive DeBusschere was vir tually inert He moved to dispel the image yesterday His forte always was defense and this time he was placed in position of defending himself Within the infrastructure of Gulf Western and its subsidiary Madi son Square Garden Center Inc De Busschere had been chosen for sacrifice in the wake of 22 defeats in the Knicks' first 33 games As execu tive vice president and general man ager he had been selected to take the foil for series of events that crippled the team s ability to compete in the National Basketball Association Cer tainly when he was dismissed without warning Friday morning he thought of himself as scapegoat cannot help but feel singled out as the only one responsible for making decisions or not making decisions he said reading prepared statement Had known that new direction or approach had been mandated would either have agreed with management on the proper way to go or would have respectfully resigned my posi tion was terribly hurt last Friday Hurt enough to aim few barbs at Gulf Western's corporate shield                 For human dignity for my own be lief he said later in more relaxed mood Tve come forward and set the facts straight as what did and did not happen As his wife Gerri noted If you know your company is behind you don't mind taking the heat They were behind him all right And now that the knife has been re- moved DeBusschere said he ll be fine                 Ten years after Phil Jackson likened the tactics of the Knicks' parent com pany to that of the acquisitive con glomerate portrayed in Mel Brooks' Silent Movie there was reason to re vive the name One of Jackson's for mer teammates among handful of Knicks whose jerseys have been re tired had been swept aside in the in terests of better business                 Of course such organizations make easy targets They frequently have been the objects of scathing social sat ire most effectively realized in the movie Network Because these huge diversified corporations are faceless and unpenetrable to outsiders it s not difficult to work up an antipathy if not antagonism toward them DeBusschere businessman and commercial spokesman himself did not offer fresh insight into the corpo rate mentality He did say that big business and professional sports don't mix Upon reflection he stated no team has ever been successful when operated as part of big business This is true in all professional sports The way it works inhibits and prohibits immediate action quick decisions and the necessary decision-making that has to be done at one level and one level only It was DeBusschere's contention the Knicks were answerable to five different levels of management and decisions and negotiations involving Bill Cartwright Patrick Ewing Louis Orr and Albert King were hampered and delayed while he shuttled back and forth between agents and mem bers of the corporate board who had to approve such matters According -to DeBusschere he and Garden presi dent Jack Krumpe who announced the firing Friday merely served as conduits of Gulf Western policy participated in all decisions De Busschere said but tell you today that if could have operated under normal structure different results would have occurred Since the man did not threaten the reputation of the Celtics' Red Auerbach in DeBuss chere s one season as general manager of the Nets and his 3% years with the Knicks we can only take his word for that But surely it seems reason able request that the blame be spread around and considerable portion be delegated to corporate headquarters

Center with the appoint ment of Michael Burke as president Gulf Wes tern has presided over series of personnel changes and desperate measures that have dazed many New York sports fans but dazzled almost no one In man agement alone Burke stood aside for Sonny Werb- lin who gave way to his former deputy Krumpe In that time the Rangers have suffered through four general managers seven coaches and more than decade of frustration Turmoil within the Knicks has been no less pronounced as management bounced head coach Red Holzman in favor of old hero Willis Reed then returned Holzman to the bench before signing Hubie Brown Eddie Donovan replaced Holzman as general manager once it was decided Red should stick to one job then he was shunted aside to meaningless position when Werb- lin and the brass at recognized the star pow er of DeBusschere All the while of course the organization chased name players throughout the country landing two alas and alack in Spencer Haywood and Bob McAdoo losing No 1 draft choice in an embarrassing attempt to sign George                 McGinnis and being taken for joyride by the re tired Wilt Chamberlain Other organizations laughed in contempt The Knicks floundered Now we have new regime or perhaps business as usual with new figurehead in Scotty Stirling DeBusschere said he hopes the new man has author ity to act on his own or the Knicks will continue on treadmill If nothing else the abrupt dismissal of the one-time star was another public relations blun der To strip man of his dignity to do this to someone who meant so much to the franchise Gerri DeBusschere said is hard to accept She told of the reaction of her youngest child Dennis who is 10. He asked Will they take down his number now Chances are not even Gulf Wes tern is that insensitive or stupid No 22 said he planned to attend Earl Monroe Night when No 15 becomes the fifth member of the 1973 championship team to have replica of his uniform hung from the ceiling and will continue to root for the Knicks The Knicks still are my team DeBusschere said Unfortunately they re also the team of Gulf- Western -r</FullText>\n",

      "\t<FullText>5M Discrepancy in Hospital Bills                 By Sandra Peddie                 Serious flaws in Stony Brook Hospital's computer system led to 5-million discrepancy between what patients were charged and the services that records show they received over two-month period according to state audit released yesterday                 The system is so flawed state offi cials said that auditors could not tell whether patients had been underbilled or accurately billed In fact the report said the hospital itself cannot be sure that it is sending accu rate bills to the 100,000 patients it treats annually The State University at Stony Brook contracts with Shared Medical Ser vices private vendor in New York to prepare the hospital s bills based on                 transactions recorded by the hospital The problem said spokeswoman for state Comptroller Edward Regan is that the numbers don't match Stony Brook University Finance Di rector Richard Brown said the discre pancy was result of misinterpretation and did not indi cate any mistakes in billing Stony Brook University President John Marburger said the hospital was not aware of misbilling of any pa tients We think there is room for im provement of record-keeping he said We understand exactly what s hap pening No records have been lost and we don't think any incorrect charges have been made State auditors who looked at billing transactions conducted in October and                 November 1984, found that bills sent to patients during the period were million higher than the value of the services recorded by the hospital But hospital officials said that the services recorded may not have accurately re flected those provided and the audi tors said they lacked enough date to tell whether patients had been over- billed underbilled or properly billed Although the report said discrepan cies were not unusual in complex com puter billing systems it criticized the hospital for not trying to correct the discrepancy That's large discre pancy the state spokeswoman said The problem is it s not accounted for Richard Covert director of Hospital Management Systems Society pro fessional group in Chicago said he                 would be concerned about discre pancy of 5 percent or more of the total billing Stony Brook's million dis is roughly 7 percent of its an nual volume of 70 million This hospital spends million annually for its computer operations which includes salaries for 63 staff and the cost of operating systems to record patient services the state comptroller said in statement In addition it pays the vendor 600 000 per year to handle patient billing This expendi ture of money and manpower is waste ful if management does not ensure that it gets from point to point Marburger said that the university hopes to install new patient account system this year that will resolve any billing problems at the 540-bed hospi tal which opened' in 1980.</FullText>\n",

      "\t<FullText>Plan now for harvest of                 fall and winter vegetables                 By Tom Stevenson The Washington Post                 Jack Frost need not put an end to your supply of home-grown vegetables In fact the best may be yet to come Some of the most popular vegetables can be started now and harvested right up to the early winter months Cool autumn weather actually improves the flavor of some of them                 While not all late-summer or early-fall planted vegetables will fully mature most are quite deli cious when young To increase the chance of their reaching maturity select those having the shortest number of days to maturity That information will be on the seed packet Wherqyer you live your county extension service can help with exact plant ing dates Remember too that cold frames can extend the productivity of your fall garden With this protec tion loosehead lettuce such as Green Ice can pro vide crisp salad greens well into the cold months Important to the fall vegetable garden is con stant and uniform supply of water The weather is often hot and dry If you allow your garden soil to dry out the vegetables will stop growing and this may affect flavors Give your summer planted crops the same good attention and cutural conditions as spring-grown ones Prepare the soil well and work in balanced garden fertilizer Such as 5-10-5, according to pack age directions Sow seeds and later thin or trans plant seedlings as instructed on seed packets Cultivate occasionally to prevent weeds Better yet use mulch It Sot only smothers weeds but also promotes better growth and holds moisture in the soil Many people like combination of turnip                 greens mustard greens and ale mixture gives good flavor to the greens by playing down the bitterness of mustard while enhancing the flavor of the turnips and kale Winter bloomdale spinach is so hardy it will live over the winter from late August sowing and be ready to supply fresh tasty greens next spring This variety usually survives even in se verely cold areas without any protection Kale and collards grown during the summer tend to be tougher and not as sweet as tl ose grown during cooler seasons Beet greens are eaten by many people It is pos sible to use both tops and roots but the tops of large beets usually are tough and often damaged by leaf spotting diseases and are seldom good for green1 Beets must grow rapidly and continuously to develop high quality Therefore there should be adequate nitrogen 'phosphorus and potash in the soil Winter radishes can be sown about the middle of August and should last until the end of Novem ber Peas fresh from the garden are always mouth watering treat in the spring They can be sown in late July or early August for fall crop The plants can stand light frost but not heavy freeze For something little unusual and extra deli cious try Chinese cabbage Burpee Hybrid is one of the best It grows fast and needs cold weather to head well jjc We were away this spring and didn't get to plant azaleas Can it be done during the summer Azaleas can be planted and transplanted al- most anytime of the year if the ground isn't frozen                 Summer is not particularly good time but it can be done successfully if handled carefully and given plenty of water during hot dry weather Any week there is not an inch of rainfall give them good soaking The black-eyed susans along the roadside are beautiful How should go about getting some to plant in my garden Seed can be collected from the wild flowers ter they have ripened usually in August and early September Store the seed in cool place and sow them indoors in February or March or out doors in April or May Some of the grass in my lawn is dying My neighbor says need to spray for chinch bugs Is there way for me to determine whether it is nec essary Chinch bugs can be bad at fcis time of year They feed on the roots of grass and usually are not noticeable Remove the bottom from coffee can shove the cylinder into the damaged grass and fill it with water Check after five or 10 minutes to see if tiny black white-winged chinch bugs are float ing in the water If spraying is necessary Spectra- cide is one of the best materials to use Directions on the label should be followed closely was given flamingo flower It was but now it looks awful What does it need Antharium flamingo flower comes from tropi cal areas of South America The average rainfall in Colombia where most kinds originate is 390 inches per year The plant requires so saturated an atmo sphere that it is almost impossible to -grow it suc                 cessfully in the home It requires high humidity warm temperatures 80 to 85 degrees and light shade had fuchsias growing outdoors last summer in pots but when it started to get cold brought them indoors They stopped blooming in December and haven't bloomed since What would cause this Fuchsias are long-day plants They need 12 hours or more of light for flowering As the days get shorter in November and December they stop blooming The grass in our lawn looks kind of wilted Our neighbor says we should water it every week Is he right Watering is good for the grass if it is needed If there is anv best time to water it probably is early morning Watering in early evening may encour age diseases since the grass will be wet all night Proper watering will keep lawn looking nicer but will not basically improve an otherwise well-man- aged kentucky bluegrass or red fescue lawn When lawns are watered they should be thoroughly soaked at infrequent intervals have problem with the weeds in my vegeta ble garden especially in small section did not plant last year Any suggestions Using weed-killing chemical would also kill the vegetable plants An easy solution is to cover the area with black plastic and anchor it with stones Weeds cannot grow under the black plastic because there is no light Pull up the weeds that are there before you put down the plastic You can plant vegetable plants through slits you can make in the plastic</FullText>\n",

First you must set up your sun dial in the right direction The sun rises in the east in the morning At night the sun sets in the west That is how to tell east and west An easy way to tell north and south is if you stand with your right hand in the east and your left hand in the west In front if you is north and behind you is south 2. Find good sunny spot 3. Draw circle in the sand or dirt 4. Put straight stick in the mid dle of the circle 5. Draw line at the top bottom and sides of the circle Make 12 in the north 3 in the east 6. in the south 9 in the west and fill in the numbers in between 6. The way to tell the time is where the Bhadow of the stick falls Example If you have to leave someplace at 2 o clock then mark that spot on the sundial When the shadow reaches that point it is 2 o clock</FullText>\n",

      "\t<FullText>New York Tech                 Reaches Level of Achievement                 By Steve Marcus                 Just two years ago New York Tech considered dropping its football program The college s Division II philosophy was resulting in high costs and losing seasons                 we naa to maxe athletic director Sam Stern said We had to drop it all together or compete in Division IH The choice was made to go Division HI Marty Senall highly regarded high school coach at South Shore High in New York City was given the job of changing Tech's losing image He took over 1-7-1 team and improved its record to 5-4-2 last year This season even more progress is expected It's already occurred off the field new weight room has been added The field has new bleachers to seat 2,000 with new scoreboard and modernized pressbox The long- range goal is lofty Hopefully we can get little national recognition as one of the best teams in Division III Stern said Stern isn't being unrealistic Two years ago his basketball team was na tionally ranked in Division II He is hoping the same for the football team and thinks Senall is the coach to do it He's been here night and day Stern said He was 5-4 last year and hopefully can build from that As for the team itself Senall is ex cited about the return of Stevie Wil liams 5-9, 215-pound tailback whom Senall describes as small but big Williams gained 600 yards in eight games last year and helped Tech win two games by kicking two 30-yard field goals At quarterback junior Mark Baron will start Hp foj yards                 and six touchdowns last season Baron may just have to be good enough to make handoff as Senall's philosophy is to run first and throw second How many good teams did you ever see that didn't have strong running game he said Still inexperience may hurt Tech on offense Senall said On defense re John Sullivan Pete Barnable Vance Stay and Dan Woods will hold the unit together somewhat easier schedule will help Senall noted We're still not technically in Division III he said because we still have some scholar ship players Division HI schools do not offer scholarships and Tech will not be considered part of Division HI until its last scholarship player gradu ates which will be in two years Be cause it has no divisional affiliation Tech will not be eligible for post-sea son berth But it would be nice to win that many Senall said The schedule Sept -- 12 Mansfield State 19 at St Lawrence 26 at Cortland Oct -- 3 New Haven 10 RPI 17 at Lowell 24 Glassboro State 31 at Iona Not 7 at Albany State 14

who was the offensive coordinator at Southwest Missouri is still getting to know his new team He doesn't mind having the added pres sure of stepping into winning situa tion To' me that takes care of

         Newsday Dan Goodrich                 Problem No 1 for the new coach is finding replacement for graduated quarterback George Muller whom Kwiatkowski called the best wing-T quarterback I've ever seen Not one of the newcomers has an ounce of exper ience Four will compete for the job including Pat O'Connor and Dom Ca- larusso who were backups to Muller last year The new coach said he did very poor job in recruiting with only 19 freshman added to the roster But he said they know that they ll have heck of an opportunity to show what they can do Although he inherited most of the team

success at Monsignor Far- rell High in Staten Island winning 103 games and losing just 13 in -14 years but he takes over team that was winless in 11 games last year This is challange as big chal lenge as any human being could want Barrett said It is an opportu nity to take over program that hit rock bottom Barrett is not predicting any instant success especially with the Mariners' difficult schedule that includes an opening game at Boston University It's going to take while he said We have large measure of improve ment but where that fits in wins and losses don't know One player Barrett can count on is senior running back Dean Doe who may be too small to make the pros but                 has been just the right size for Kings Point's Division II schedule Doe aver aged 179 yards game last year for total of 1,397 yards and nine touch downs He is the academy s all-time leader in vards gained rushing with 2,527.

What is true is remember lot of comebacks here but never remember us coming back with two outs and no body on and down by bunch ITie bottom of the eighth opened in enough Bob Lemon would have liked to have brought in Rich Gossage when Guidry said he had had enough of the dank rainy afternoon But the Yankees' big reliever has not been available since pulling groin muscle shagging flies in the outfield in Milwaukee earlier in the week He's getting better Lemon said but didn't want to risk working him on that wet mound Besides Davis the alternate choice had returned to his first-half form of late Friday night against the Red Sox he had come on to retire seven straight hitters and gain victory And two hit                 ters into the eighth there was abso lutely no reason for concern he had retired Jerry Remy on ground ball and came back from 3-and-0 count to fan Dwight Evans had good stuff Davis said had just as good stuff as had last night An inkling of what was to come was provided by Jim Rice single high off the leftfield wall Then Davis walked Yastrzemski on four straight pitches He wasn't throwing the same as the first time the Red Sox captain said He was bringing it then But the big difference was his control He was missing bad                 When Davis struggled earlier in the second season there was discomfort in the bicep of his pitching arm Working two straight days might have vated that trouble but if it did he re fused to admit it have no excuses he said just never have had any good luck pitching in rainy weather The ball is slippery the hands are wet But if get beat get beat I'm not going to worry about this one don't need any excuses Carney Lansford lined single to right to score Rice and make the score 5-2. Dave Stapleton doubled down the rightfield line to score Yastrzemski                 When Reggie Jackson had trouble picking up the ball Lansford also scored on the rightfielder s error The Yankees' lead had been reduced to 5-4.

      "\t<FullText>Defense Budget The Bottom Line Or Bottomless Pit                 OTIS PIKE                 THERE IS such degree of confusion about what the President intends to spend on defense in order to protect us from our enemies and protect us from our- selves that it is time to review the bidding                 In one of his last acts as President Jimmy Carter submitted on Jan 15 proposed budget for the year that starts Oct 1. That year is fiscal 1982. For fiscal 1982, Carter proposed that we authorize for defense purposes the sum of 195 billion This was an increase of 25 billion over the 1981 figure and it would provide said Carter course of sustained and balanced improvements in defense programs that will require real annual in creases in funding of about 5 per cent per year The key word in the unreal world of defense spending is real As Carter used it the word meant 5 per cent above the rate of inflation An inflation rate of 10 per cent would have required spending increases of 15 per cent to maintain the sustained and balanced improvements the de- parting President called for Not enoughs-said -the-' incoming                 President Not enough said the in coming Congress One month Jater Reagan got standing ovation as he told joint session of Congress what his economic program consisted of He called for cutting Carter's pro posed 1982 spending not including defense by 41 billion He called                 for cutting Carter's proposed 1982 tax revenues by 53 billion But when it came to defense Rea gan said It is the only department in our entire program that will actu ally be increased over the present budget figure believe that my duty as President requires that -recommend- increases in defense                 spending over the coming years Well Carter had recommended in creases in defense spending over the coming years too 5 per cent in real annual increases What did Reagan recommend Reagan took Carter's 195 billion for 1982 and upped it to S221 billion For comparison the 1980 figure for the same purposes was 142 bil lion meaning that in current dollars two Presidents have proposed and two Congresses have accepted in creasing defense spending by 55 per cent in two years What does it mean in real dollars No one knows for no one knows what the inflation rate will be for the fiscal year starting Oct 1. We aren't even certain what the final figure will be for the year that ends on Sept 30. What does it add in real defense great deal less than it adds in real dollars Defense manpower and pro                 costs inflate faster than the rate of inflation B-l bombers and MX missiles and Trident submarines are completely ineffective in preventing hostages from being seized in Iran or military headquarters being blown up in West Germany We are- spending all our money                 on the war we are not going to fight Now comes the confusion On Tuesday the news out of California was that the President was willing to cut his proposed defense budget not for fiscal 1982, but for 1983 and 1984, by up to 30 billion On Wednesday senior Pentagon official traveling to Honolulu aboard plane carrying Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger that Pentagon official is Wein berger folks said he was absolutely certain that no decisions had been made to cut defense spending On Wednesday the President said in Chicago that his willingness to cut defense spending does not mean we are retreating from the program we adopted of an annual 7 per cent in crease in defense spending Now comes the old shell game Seven per cent of what If it is to be 7 per cent above the 1980 budget it is easy even in terms of constant dol lars We are way ahead of that right now If it is to be 7 per cent above the 1981 defense budget of Carter 170 billion it is still easy Reagan added almost billion to the 1981 defense budget making it 177 bil lion Is it to bs 7 per cent above that Is it to be 7 per cent above Carter's last budget the one he proposed for fiscal 1982? Or finally is it to be 7 per cent above the 1SC2 budget as Reagan amended it That one would be very difficult to increase for that is the one which has already been increased by 55 per cent in two years It is tough trying to find the bot tom line when the President isn't even saying where he s starting from Jack Altshul is                 'Two Presidents have proposed and two Congresses have accepted in creasing defense spending by 55 per cent in two years</FullText>\n",

The Senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations sent Shultz letter yesterday approving the full 60 million But Rep Clarence Long D-Md chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee put off action until after the congressional Easter recess even though yesterday was supposed to be the deadline He said severe family illnesses made it impossible to get all the members together this week Long said in an interview Thursday that the Democratic- controlled panel is going to be harder-nosed than the Senate committees He said his subcommittee would be unlikely to approve more than 30 million and quite possibly less The Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it believes that the United States should use its good offices to encourage an unconditional dialogue among all parties to the conflict in El Salvador in the hope of achieving political resolution Salvadorans mark anniversary of archbishop s slaying Page 11.)

purchasing import ed goods at rate unprecedented since the Civil War when much of this country s merchandise still came from overseas Less than four decades after the United States emerged from World War II as the undisputed man ufacturing giant of its time the nation s continued appetite for consumer goods is increasingly being satisfied from abroad often from countries that as recently as 20 years ago were synonymous with shoddy merchandise Joseph Juran management consultant who was among the Americans to teach Japan about quality control said in an interview that as the champions the industrial West had no idea the                 Japanese had come up out of nowhere to compete with them The result Though the United States continues to be the world s largest economy and by some indices still the world s most productive it has lost consumer loyalty to foreign manufacturers who have large and increasing share of market once dominated by American firms This historic development raises fundamental and far-reaching question that Newsday reporters have explored in variety of industries faced with foreign competition Can American manufacturers still turn out products that American consumers will want to buy American companies have almost always faced substantial competition from abroad but never to this extent Foreign pressures have hit harder and they ve hit larger sections of American industry economist Robert Heilbroner said The most visible impact has been on the manu facturers of consumer goods products whose brands define the contents of our kitchens closets living rooms and garages From dishwashers and cars to shoes and shirts these are the products that speak eloquently about consumers' daily choices In the apparel industry alone of wov en and knit goods rose from 3.6 percent of domes tic consumption in 1956 to 19.1 percent in 1970 and are predicted to exceed 50 percent this year Imported cars which accounted for less than one- quarter of 1 percent of car sales in 1950, rose to 15 percent in 1970 and 26 percent last year figure that experts say would be closer                 to 40 percent or more if voluntary Japanese im port quotas were lifted Last year imports almost all from Japan accounted for 95 percent of motorcycles sold in the United States 60 percent of TV sets 40 percent of hand-held calculators Twenty years ago imports made up less than 10 percent of the sales of any of those products With the flood of imports product loyalty was steadily eroded as American buyers be came accustomed to foreign merchandise that proved to be gradually less expensive more reliable or both Though the inroads made by imported products are deep there is evidence that consumers are in creasingly upbeat about the quality of American- made goods Today the issue with many American buyers is not so much quality how well something is made but the more complex question of value for money Though foreign-made cameras or shirts may not always claim an edge in quality they often are priced lower than comparable Americas goods We are talking about perception of what is worth the price said Armand Feigenbaum quality-control expert whose ideas were adapted by the Japanese It is not the engineer who determines the perception Not salesman Certainly not an advertising man It is the user the consumer Newsday's study of industries besieged by competition from foreign makers has come up with mosaic of findings some pointing to signs that the American industry is recovering from the slump of Continued on Page 29

       Continued from Page 5 the late 1970s, others showing deep-rooted uncer beneath the apparent comeback Among the findings of the Newsday sampling American auto manufacturers are proving they can do again what they once did so well make money Profits in Detroit are at record levels But the industry is plagued by fundamental weaknesses Much of Detroit's new blush of financial health is due to the protective barrier of voluntary Japanese quotas The quality of the cars has not dramatically changed according to generally accepted standards despite some improvements And while auto makers are making forward-looking changes in de sign and in production techniques they still lag behind foreign competitors which frequently offer better value for the money The fiercely competitive and very robust domestic appliance industry is feeling Japanese competitors closing in So far however it has man aged to forestall foreign pressure on most products through the widespread use of robotics computer ized production management strict quality control and unusually generous warranty policies Price not quality is the battleground for the apparel industry Because of much cheaper la bor rates overseas makers of shirts sweaters and other garments enjoy crippling price advantage American garment makers are trying to offset this by investing increasingly in highly automated pro duction systems domestically by parceling out greater part of their production to overseas contrac tors and by seeking protectionist measures from the government The automation gamble is paying off in higher quality but price still is problem In consumer electronics imports have routed American brands from the shelves stark example No black-and-white TV sets sold in the United States are made in the United States Cheaper labor rates and huge gap in technology are the reasons In the research and development of computers and related technology American firms have sig nificant edge over the Japanese competition The ar East however is major supplier of manufactured components and is strengthening its push to gain foothold in low-cost portable computer market The Newsday study found that while the furniture makers are changing their ways to survive amid cut-throat domestic competition the industry has for the most part enjoyed quirky immunity from foreign competition chiefly because of an abundant supply of raw materials But few other traditional manufacturing indus tries can hope for competition to end at the water s edge Indeed the Newsday study points to the neces sity for American manufacturers policymakers and labor leaders to adapt to vastly changed global                 economy where pre-eminence has eroded steadily since the end of World War II The undercurrents run deep The new global economic order will affect the way the United States shapes its fiscal and mone tary policies and its diplomatic relations with allies and trading partners The adjustments that must be made for firms to remain competitive worldwide could be felt in every American home They will help determine the value of the dollar the price of credit the types of jobs available the way children are educated and the standard of living to which Americans aspire Ultimately that new order will raise questions about the way American consumers and businesses view themselves Can American manufacturers re vert to the dominant position they enjoyed for so                 long after World War II Should they even try Will American consumers care Jerry Jasinowski chief economist of the Na tional Association of Manufacturers said It's pretty clear we are slow to change unless motivated to do so by losing jobs and profitability The catalyst is fear There are historical ironies here Mass produc tion that is the system of manufacturing based on interchangeable parts and the division of labor is widely credited as one of the United States' most outstanding contributions to technology Specialized labor and the use of machines in pro duction date back to the manufacture of pins in France and England in the 1760s. Then in 1798, Eli Whitney the inventor of the cotton-gin proposed that flintlocks be manufactured using interchange- Continued on Page 31                 Newsday Chart Brigitte Zimmer                 No Longer An American Buy Continued from Page 29 able parts machined in standard patterns by un- skilled workers Until then muskets had been painstakingly hand-fitted by skilled gunsmiths and when one broke in battle it could not be easily re paired French armorers were working along the same lines and Thomas Jefferson was impressed enough on visit to Prance to recommend the new manufacturing technique to the War Department But it was not until decades later that armories in Massachusetts Connecticut and Virginia began adopting the mass production idea It was not until the 1880s that bicycle and sewing machine makers started using the revolutionary notion of inter changeable parts And it was not until Henry Ford cranked up Model production that the modern conveyor-belt assembly line became an accepted practice in 1913. By the end of World War If American companies had become undisputed masters of mass production The seemingly insatiable hunger for consumer goods that followed the war caused manufacturers to con centrate on production to satisfy domestic demand In the first postwar decades America's economy rewarded much of its workforce The need to develop foreign markets seemed irrelevant Moreover in the rush for immediate profits American companies brushed aside the importance of developing new manufacturing techniques For years after World War II Detroit automakers used assembly tech niques not much different from those used thirty years earlier while garment manufacturers were slow to adopt automated systems that would have been more profitable in the face of escalating labor costs In 1946 the first applications of mathematical models to production were being developed in this country They' would result decades later in the computer terminals used by such manufacturers as the Arrow Shirt Co Meanwhile American experi were coming up with the first electronical ly-controlled machine tools harbingers of today s manufacturing robots It was not the Americans however who would adopt those revolutionary techniques in production of consumer goods The Japanese whose govern ment played an active role in the economy honing the competitiveness of key industries would steal the American manufacturing fire in robotics and computer technology and would apply these ad vances to the automobile and electronics industries long before the Americans The import flood which began as an cant trickle in the 1950s, swelled to steady stream in the 1960s, ledby transistor radios from Japan and the suddenly ubiquitous Volkswagen Beetle from                 West Germany By the 1970s, the United States'' vanquished foes of World War II had become its fiercest competitors for consumer market shares Shoes and clothes from Italy and cars from Japan and West Germany were displacing brand names that once had been imprinted in the American con sciousness as cultural totems ECA Harley-David- son Timex Chevrolet the brand names of Americans' childhood would be challenged if not replaced by Sony Kawasaki Casio Toyota Quality and value for money were the competitive weapons Debra Owens manager with the American So ciety for Quality Control said Now the American consumer is seeing cars perfect when they get them and they don't have to keep taking them back to be fixed It's not that our quality was not improv ing But the Japanese eventually hit and then ex ceeded us By the time we realized what was happening we were losing our share of the market After World War she said Americans were happy to get car Detroit just made them Fine- tuning went on after the car was bought People sort of expected it to have bugs in it The fine-tuning was not' built in It was put in When inflation was low and the economy was booming in the postwar period up to the mid- 1960s, American consumers could afford to be wasteful Goods were cheap purchasing power was highland even if clothes wore out too quickly or cars broke down too soon they could be replaced or trad ed without disastrous effect on family finances The result was the infamous planned obsolescence that characterized American marketing for decades In the 1970s, things changed High inflation and the Arab oil embargo along with rising consumer                 movement combined to rouse American buyers from their traditional passivity Drivers for exam ple shopped for car that would fast twice as long and use half as much gas and no American auto maker was equipped to produce one Imports seemed the easiest way to get value for the dollar These gradual but distinct changes in consumer buying trends the intense competitive pressure to which domestic manufacturers are trying to re spond and the painful adjustments faced by Ameri can workers are all part of an uneasy evolution of American industry Underlying that transition are inexorable shifts in the way firms compete the way products are made and the nature of the market place itself which haa gone from safe and limited national or regional arena to global free-for-all Increasingly economists and marketers talk of world cars or universal consumers The success ful company of the future some experts say is no longer the decentralized multinational that offers several variations of product to suit national con ditions but centralized global company making well-thought-out single line of products suited to all markets with small regional variations World wide competition is now part of life said Theodore Levitt professor at the Harvard Business School The result is homogenization of production and marketing techniques with less choice for consum ers For example the Nikon cameras sold on the Japanese market are exactly the same cameras sold in West Germany and the United States the buyer of Honda automobiles unlike the Chevrolet customer of

torpor and forced it to adopt manufacturing technologies and management styles used successfully by their for eign competitors More important it has led to national re-examination on the definition of produc tivity and quality in manufacturing It has forced American industries to question their marketing gpals And it has moved policymakers to reconsider the role of government intervention in international trade If the United States is embattled in this global marketing struggle some of its chief competitors are beginning to feel similar pressure from less-devel- oped countries Japan which has squeezed -Ameri can steelmakers brutally already is raising tariff barriers against cheap South Korean steel imports South Korean autos are beginning to appear else where in East Asia European heavy industry is even more sluggish to respond to competition from the Third World than are the Americans And the Americans are responding Ford and General Motors are adopting tech niques that might once have been dismissed as Uto pian Both automakers for example are enacting long-ignored recommendations from quality-control experts widely credited with launching Japanese automakers on their successful course When Ford retooled to build its Escort assemblers worked to gether with engineers to ensure that the work sta tion where engines are lifted into cars are at the safest and most comfortable heights for the workers The results show The Escort is the best-selling small car in the United States and Pontiac's sporty Fiero is considered by GM to be its best-made car American shirtmakers challenged by cheap im ports from the Far East are mechanizing In Aus tell Ga at Arrow's regional cutting and warehousing facility handful of workers sit at yel low computer screens laying

4,250 dozen shirts week compared with 2,800 dozen before technology and productivity gains expanded the as sembly work force to -404 people from 325. But for much of American industry nagging problem remains Expensive technology even if it results in higher quality and eventually somewhat lower prices still may not be competitive with com inexpensive overseas labor In an effort to address the issue of quality and value Chrysler gives its buyers five-year 50 000- mile warranty on its new cars policy that s meant to convey its confidence in its engineering Ford says innovations to eliminate manufacturing defects in its Escort sub-compact have led to the closing of repair shop that received flawed cars after inspec tion at the end of the assembly line Carmakers are reporting record profits due in part to their adaptation to the new environment of robotics and the automated factory but also because of lower gasoline prices and dose of protectionism in the form of Japanese voluntary quotas on imports Industry analysts caution that current strong sales and profits do not mean the competition is over Ultimately the American manufacturers will have to convince consumers that their products are competitive by offering the same kind of quality and value for money that Americans have come to expect from imports You can t advertise your way out of poor prod uct said consultant Feigenbaum who helped es tablish the concept of total quality control in which companies use statistical measures to moni tor product quality Higher consumer expectations are the driving force behind growth in this country he said What quality finally comes down to is satisfying the user The Japanese concentrated on doing precisely that American firms didn't Today recent surveys indicate that public per ception of the quality in American-made goods no longer is as dismal as it was only few years ago And the American economy remains strong by vir tue of its size and influence its diversity and flexi bility It still is the engine that leads much of the capitalist world But there are areas in which the nation has fallen back like steel and electronics areas in which the United States may never again be pre-eminent Said economist Heilbronen We are not going to be impoverished tomorrow but we may be in the uncomfortable position of being in second or third place in some areas to the Japanese and the Ger mans NEXT The Automobile Industry</FullText>\n",

But then hit good passing shot that hit the tape and landed over on his side and he hit winner Lendl said and then                 he got my volley with volley to make it deuce Replay The sequence was better than Lendl described it more athletic and with more tension than any other points in the match probably Lendl's passing shot at 15-40 was baseline forehand whistling down the line catching the net cord on the left side and as McEnroe tracked it down kick ing in the air toward the middle of the court McEnroe spun 180 degrees and flicked forehand to the open court At 30-40, Lendl went to the net and whacked forehand volley that McEn roe picked off with his own volley And then McEnroe hit backhand winner cross-court Lendl netted forehand re turn and McEnroe had held serve There was just enough time at 1 hour 40 minutes the men s final was seven minutes shorter than Saturday's women s final in those quick                 Sets for McEnroe winner in 66 of 68 matches this year to show that he has every tennis shot known But still yes terday s match was paper plates and plastic utensils with the fine China having been broken out only on Satur day in this two- week tournament Normally McEnroe might have Wandered away from the business at hand against Lendl but his semifinal against Connors extracted so much from him tennis guts blood flesh skin that he didn't get angry at anything because knew needed ev ery' ounce of energy had The Rolls Royce already in the ga rage he had to go to town in the jalopy Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver captured the women s doubles title for the second consecutive year defeating Anne Hobbs and Wendy Tornbull 6-2, 6-4.
