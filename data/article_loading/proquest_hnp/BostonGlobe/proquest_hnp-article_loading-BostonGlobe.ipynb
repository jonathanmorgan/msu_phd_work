Multifarious, multitudinous, manifold are the taxes in the Brazilian capital.Tenants pay 12 percent of the rental in taxes, or 10 percent if there are no sewer connections and 6 percent in the suburbs. This is by far the greatest source of revenue. Next comes the enormous amount raised by commercial licenses. From the bootblack, who is obliged to pay $16.25 annually, to the banker, who is taxed $812 50 each year, all sorts and conditions of business men paY a license tax. Ev en the street porter pays $26 a Year for the privilege of carrying burdens and running errands A small prevision dealer, mth a capital of not more than $2a00, pays not far from $200 a,Year in licenses and special taxes.About $9,000,000 are raised annually by taxation, and of that amount $9950 comes from the vacant land tax.

The stream or \"run,\" about three miles t: of the camp, was crossed by several fords, and to protect them against the force the federals would be Iikety to send would take many more men than could be gathered at i&gt;-sas, were an early union advance begun.No record of Gen Lee's thoughts, as he examined this fated ground 50 years ago today, Is to De had; but In a letter to his wife, dated \", 7  8.\" and relating to  in residence enforced on various relatives by the Presence of the union army !n Virginia, he wrote these  lines:\"I fear I cannot be with you anywhere. I do not think Richmond  iil be permanent.Before the great struggle was  begun the greatest southern Leader, rld-!ng over what he termed \"my    n neighborhood,\" to  out a battlefield, foresaw the disaster that was to come from the  of  and trying to 'defend a fixed capital for the confederacy.Weakness of Ball l2un.'Gen Lee's estimate of the strength of Bull run was shared by Gen Beauregard, who arrived about this time and made a careful inspection o! the ground before formally taking command at  Iaaasans.In his report to Pres Davls he declared that the fords on thq stream \"are so numerous and so2lar apart that a much larger force than I have here at my command (say not less than 10,000 or Ib,000 men) could not hope to defend them all against a well organized enemy of about 0,000 men who could select his point of .\"I moat therefore be reinforced at once,\" he continued, \"as I have not more than about g000 e2 . or 1 must be Prepared to retire upon the  of the enemy in the direction of , orb must march to meet hhn at sae of the fords and sect our lives dearly.\"The confederate general s estimate of =J.000 men as the force that might pa scat against him' showed how closely the southern leaders paged their -nent s strength for a battle weeks .n advance of the event. The union ford actually engaged !n the battle of Bull run was to be about that number.it bile there was little comfort to Geya Lee sad Beauregard In the country n which :hey must make their stand, there w-as scarcely more In the condition o: their troops.Gen Benuregard described his eom-mand as \"badly armed and badly  \"  sev era! regiments having \"but one or two field ot8cers.\" Their camp was is open country, and                 too large to be easily do:ended without  earthworks. These he began to throw up. this period work on the       3ca5 tions could be procured from the trod%s,\" says Gen Eeauregard's biographer, Alfred Aoman. \"Most of their time was necessarily taken up with drills and manual labor was In Itself no light task for them, composed, as the commands generally were, of young men of good position at home, who had responded to the first call of the country (the confederacy), many of them having come width no small amount of loge-age and even with body servants.1' answer to company  was that they were there to light and not to handle the pick and shovel.Gen Beauregard abstained from employing them on any but the most essential works, and employed, as far as possible, negro labor.\"Situation in Virginia.The military situation of 50 years ago today In \\';, outside the section near R'ashington, was as follows:The confederacy had under arms In the stata about 30,000 men. About a third of these mere yet fn camps of instruction near Richmond.At Harpers ferry was a command of  70pp men under Gen Joseph);. Johnston. Ha was confronted by a union force of superior strength on the the Maryland side of the Potomac This was commanded by Gen Robert Yatterson of Pennsylvania.Ono of the confederates' strongest reasons for holding Manassas was to provide for the  of Gen Johnston's army with that of Gen Beauregard fn case of emergency.In western              another  confederate arms' under Gen R. S. Gar-nett, who was already opposed by Gea George B, \\, marching from Ohio with more than 20,000 men.Ori the peninsula,-near Yorktown, was a confederate force of about two full regiments of infantry under Gen John Ii. Magruder, and at fort 3 was a union garrison being strengthened to 10.000 men under Gen H. R.

There is no saying when you can return to your home or 'what may be its condition when you do return. \\\\hat, then, can you do in tho meantime?\"Gen MeDowell at Arlington addressed 3Lrs Lee a Letter, about this time. which was a. model of courtesy.\"I am here temporarily in camp on the grounds,\" he wrote. \"preferring this to sleeping fn the house, under the circumstances which the painful state of the country places me with respect to Its proprietors.I assure you.
