He was throwing 97, was throwing 94.

neighborhoods Said city planning director Thomas Pelham There was strong statement by the neighborhood that we want not redevelopment According to Pelham 85 per cent of the homes around the square are owner-occupied which makes for one hedge against newly razed but prime piece of land at the edge of the square has been set aside for 54 housing units for the elderly Construction will begin this

considerable sentiment against plans to level the commercial and residential buildings on what Is called the Bucna vista and construct an office-retail complex and 240-car parking garage The city took

Use of the breakdown lane will relieve congestion while the state constructs two lanes one north one south In the median strip An environmental analysis Is un der way on the estimated 50 mil lion project 90 percent of which will be patd for with federal dol lars Barring unexpected environ mental problems construction would begin as soon as design work Is complete according to state transportation officials and the lanes could be completed with in about five years The Rte 12 segment targeted for new lanes Is about 15 miles long starting at the intersection of Rte 9 and stretching south to where Rte 24 branches off In Randolph Developers municipal officials and business representatives heard about the expansion from state officials at day-long confer ence In Burlington yesterday on the future of Rte 128.

There must also be new em phasis on mass transit van pool ing and staggered shifts at major In the area The only way that Rte 128 will be able to accommodate the continued growth which Is the centerpiece of our economy Is through cooperative effort by state and local officials area busi ness and commuters said stale Transportation Secretary Freder ick Salvuccl In announcing new state study of Rte 128 con gestion Along with adding lanes Salvuccl said the state s plans In clude Improvement to many Inter changes along the highway and renewed emphasis on reducing the number of cars that use It dal ly- No official approval yet Michael Meyer director of the state Bureau of Transportation Planning and Development said that although the federal govern ment has not yet given official ap proval for the use of the break down lanes he has been told In formally that It will be permitted Salvuccl too said that federal offi                 cials have looked at It generally favorably and we are expected to get permission within one month Details on funding for con struction were sketchy yesterday but Deputy Transportation Secre tary Allan McKlnnon was confi dent funds will be available Said McKlnnon don't know where the money Is In the pipeline but there Is little question that when we are ready to build the money will be there Forbodlng statistics were deliv ered by Salvuccl and McKlnnon Among them At current development rates 20.000 Jobs are expected to be added along the Rtc 128 corri dor by the end of next year Over the the 1980s. 150.000 Jobs will have been added In the 28 commu nities along 128. That translates Into as many as 90,000 new cars on the highway according to planners' best estimates Said McKlnnon Obviously the good news Is our people will be working the bad news Is that Rtc 128 may not be Already one stretch of Rte 128 has as much traffic as the Southeast Expressway The state plans to Invest more than 200 billion on Im provements to Rte 128 and Its ac cess roads in the next five years but the investment is not expected to compensate for increased traf-                 Itc Recent traffic counts suggest that If the economy remains strong and the expected business expansion occurs the traffic counts In some sections of Rtc 128 will rival the traffic counts on the Central Artery and actually surpass those of the Southeast Ex said McKlnnon Over two decades we will have added 300,000 Jobs on that corri dor with basically the same road we had 20 years ago Word of the expansion of the three-lane portion of Rte 128 be                 tween Ncedham and Randolph lagged by officials as one of the three worst of Rte 128 pleased conference participants although the Improvements were viewed as only one small part of the overall plan to avoid what one called the potential for gridlock on the highway McKlnnon also said that the state has requested use of the breakdown lane on Rte 3 between Weymouth and Han                 over It certainly is good news it will help out significantly said William Kimball or Spauldlng Slyc Investment builders brokers and managers He represented Rte 128 businesses some of which have commissioned their own traffic studies on Rte 128. According to Meyer the widen ing of the southern stretch of Rtc 128 Is expected to alleviate about 90 percent of the congestion that slows rush hour traffic There may still be some problems at the Interchanges he said                 GLOBE MAP</FullText>\n",

PNC has long embraced the covenant which calls for re of Palestine on the land now claimed by Israel and the elimination of the Jewish state In the Mfdeast Israel's objections to the PNC option are coupled Ironically with the PLO's refusal to permit PNC members who are not direct ly associated with the PLO to rep resent Palestinians The PLO was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people In 1974 at an Arab summit in Rabat and the organization which Is locked In factional struggle with Syr ian-supported Palestinian dissi dents who oppose the leadership of Yasser

He was throwing 97, was throwing 94. Great fun I'll do anything for the Red Sox to help them win Stewart Is 51-45 for his career but over the last three years he has averaged 58 appearances sev                 en wins and 10 saves year His nature this is man who has done Michael Jack son Imitations on the mound tried to pitch to Dave Revering left-handed and docs the Chuck Berry Duck Walk when Intro duced grated on the Orioles They claimed he d been late 21 times this past season and while his one Indiscretion was far back In the past he admitted to it and adopted Huey Lewis' Want New Drug as his antl-alchohol theme It seemed to follow him If we had any concerns we certainly wouldn't have made the deal Gorman said We have none One reason Stewart looks for ward to Boston Is because of the city s medical facilities Bath his children 6--old Colin and 3- year-old Alicia suffer from cystic fibrosis It was In Boston that they Isolated the genes and made the one dramatic breakthrough said Stewart If we have to move It's great to move to Boston Some of his teammates may have criticized him behind his back but coach Elrod Hendricks calls him one tough SOB lot of us don't know what he s been through and former pitching coach Ray Miller says Pressure never bothers him he might have made me mad but he hasn't exactly had the easiest life As Stewart was slammed as he left Baltimore so the Red Sox put In their press release that Gutier rez made 20 errors In his last 66 games But remember these facts In an era In which Latin America has become vital breeding ground for talent he Is the only Latin player developed by the Red Sox the last team to have black player who started half one season s games at one posi tion for them he was their rookie of the year In 1984; the Red Sox do not have Spanish- speaking Instructors during the regular season they are one of only six teams that refuse to open schools In the Dominican Repub lic baseball s richest talent area Gutierrez Is an intelligent                 quality person from baseball- backward country who was brought up In an organization that scoffs at minor league or Lat in coaches made It to the big leagues on his own made only two errors before getting hurt on May 24 and took criticism for not being able to make the double play while the player who should have been working out with him around the bag spent his spring training In the shade Hoffman has been the regular for five of the last six years Gor man said We feel Qulnonez will be ready by the end of the sea son Maybe Qulnonez wilt be the first Latin player the Red Sox have developed to be given the chance to play regularly two sea sons For now however Joaco Gu goes to Baltimore to play third base When Earl Weaver leaves he Is expected to be the shortstop with Cal Ripken mov ing to third This said Orioles Jim Russo Is trade for the long term Since Gorman made it clear that he Intends to work out an ex tension to keep Stewart from free agency next fall the Red Sox share that opinion</FullText>\n",

Use of the breakdown lane will relieve congestion while the state constructs two lanes one north one south In the median strip An environmental analysis Is un der way on the estimated 50 mil lion project 90 percent of which will be patd for with federal dol lars Barring unexpected environ mental problems construction would begin as soon as design work Is complete according to state transportation officials and the lanes could be completed with in about five years The Rte 12 segment targeted for new lanes Is about 15 miles long starting at the intersection of Rte 9 and stretching south to where Rte 24 branches off In Randolph Developers municipal officials and business representatives heard about the expansion from state officials at day-long confer ence In Burlington yesterday on the future of Rte 128.

There must also be new em phasis on mass transit van pool ing and staggered shifts at major In the area The only way that Rte 128 will be able to accommodate the continued growth which Is the centerpiece of our economy Is through cooperative effort by state and local officials area busi ness and commuters said stale Transportation Secretary Freder ick Salvuccl In announcing new state study of Rte 128 con gestion Along with adding lanes Salvuccl said the state s plans In clude Improvement to many Inter changes along the highway and renewed emphasis on reducing the number of cars that use It dal ly- No official approval yet Michael Meyer director of the state Bureau of Transportation Planning and Development said that although the federal govern ment has not yet given official ap proval for the use of the break down lanes he has been told In formally that It will be permitted Salvuccl too said that federal offi                 cials have looked at It generally favorably and we are expected to get permission within one month Details on funding for con struction were sketchy yesterday but Deputy Transportation Secre tary Allan McKlnnon was confi dent funds will be available Said McKlnnon don't know where the money Is In the pipeline but there Is little question that when we are ready to build the money will be there Forbodlng statistics were deliv ered by Salvuccl and McKlnnon Among them At current development rates 20.000 Jobs are expected to be added along the Rtc 128 corri dor by the end of next year Over the the 1980s. 150.000 Jobs will have been added In the 28 commu nities along 128. That translates Into as many as 90,000 new cars on the highway according to planners' best estimates Said McKlnnon Obviously the good news Is our people will be working the bad news Is that Rtc 128 may not be Already one stretch of Rte 128 has as much traffic as the Southeast Expressway The state plans to Invest more than 200 billion on Im provements to Rte 128 and Its ac cess roads in the next five years but the investment is not expected to compensate for increased traf-                 Itc Recent traffic counts suggest that If the economy remains strong and the expected business expansion occurs the traffic counts In some sections of Rtc 128 will rival the traffic counts on the Central Artery and actually surpass those of the Southeast Ex said McKlnnon Over two decades we will have added 300,000 Jobs on that corri dor with basically the same road we had 20 years ago Word of the expansion of the three-lane portion of Rte 128 be                 tween Ncedham and Randolph lagged by officials as one of the three worst of Rte 128 pleased conference participants although the Improvements were viewed as only one small part of the overall plan to avoid what one called the potential for gridlock on the highway McKlnnon also said that the state has requested use of the breakdown lane on Rte 3 between Weymouth and Han                 over It certainly is good news it will help out significantly said William Kimball or Spauldlng Slyc Investment builders brokers and managers He represented Rte 128 businesses some of which have commissioned their own traffic studies on Rte 128. According to Meyer the widen ing of the southern stretch of Rtc 128 Is expected to alleviate about 90 percent of the congestion that slows rush hour traffic There may still be some problems at the Interchanges he said                 GLOBE MAP</FullText>\n",

The builder or the realtor can then arrange an inspection tour of .the house to examine each item and remedy those that should be checked.                 The home owner who DOESN'T report the Imperfections he finds in his new home can present bigger headaches to the builder than a chronic nag. In some cases the new owner discovers a flaw and Is at once convinced that, .Instead of his \"dream home,' he s saddled with aa lemon., And instead of nipping the  in the bud, it festers                 and n.  1 owner, he b  he s .                 Today there Is. no* need for this, :and most builders go far beyond their bounden responsibilities in the interest of good will.                 Just where does the builder s                 responsibility end, and 1 the buyer s begin? To settle I this point, builders across the I country are Issuing a written &lt; warranty with the new home.                 This warranty Is generally re- I viewed when title to the I home is being conveyed.                 The warranty spells out precisely what the builder is responsible for, and alerts the home  to those items he must be responsible for. Builders welcome the written warranty idea,  there is no need for a conscientious builder-to have his life made miserable by the chronic complaints of an unreasonable buyer, nor any need for a homeowner to                 be the  of the builder s I forgetfulness.                 What's M Warranty? 1 Just what' should go into as new - home warranty? Some i                 new suburbanites would, no doubt, insist on perpetual care for their lawns and to hear builders and realtors swapping notes. This is no exaggeration. We've noticed in recent months a tendency among builders of less expensive homes to admit having more complaints about grading and                 seeding, oi just \"poor lawns.\" i                 The first natural reaction is I  the less-expensive home I probably received a cheaper I quality grass seed and loam- I but checking this out has I proven that Identical quality I was used An homes where I ]awns were top-quality, and i almost without regard for price                 of the home. But where build- I ers have followed up the prob- I lem, they often find that the                 newly transplanted city - i ler is not accustomed or in- i clined to care for anywhere I from one-quarter to one-anda-half acres of green, when                 he never even used to own a I lawn  I                 Will the home building In- I dustry ever systematize the I warranty aspect to the same i extent that the  I manufacturers have? I would 4 predict that they will - In i fact, the automobile manufacturers may one day take a                 lesson from home builders. 1                 Right at this time there Is I a committee at work within I the Home Builders Assn. of ( Greater Boston; evaluating I earliest results of a field test c that it has been  I since mid-Summer. Builders, who are members of the as- i                 ---------+- ++- + w + +                 sociation were selected to put into operation a standard warranty, to check it for practical application and workability in the harsh light of everyday business. Early results point to the need for only minor language clarifications-where home owners were confused by builder s lingo - but by and large the warranty concept is meeting with highly favorable response from the home buying public.                 In the case of lawns, for example, the warranty spells out that the builder is responsible for the initial  and seeding on all disturbed areas on both sides of the house, in the front, and for at least 30 feet 'to the rear, - and all other disturbed areas will be graded. The warranty pledges that quality seed has - been used, but reminds the buyer that lawns must be watered carefully to receive the equivalent of one inch rainfall per week, should be fertilized in April and late August, and bare spots reseeded.                 The greatest advantage to the standard warranty is that it eliminates, needless doubts, confusion and sometimes hostility. Only a suggested \"bill of rights,\" even when in final form the Home Builders Assn: suggests that the standard warranty be amended at the                 time of paper-passing to incorporate specific agreements as to responsibilities. By eliminating the doubts, much needless worry and concern can be eliminated.                 Of the many components that go into today s home, a number of them are covered by manufacturers' warranty, and ordinarily are satisfactorily resolved when either the builder or the home owner contacts the manufacturer s service department, But, builders are anxious to know when their buyers have complaints against manufacturers of materials or appliances. Also, builders must keep a close watch ot the many subcontractors - plumbers, electricians, heating contractors - and if they don't remedy defects when reported, the builders can \"drop\" them.                 The nearly-completed warranty form will be made available to all members of the Home Builders Assn. of Greater Boston.</FullText>\n",

Mr. Lewis said.                 \"While pledging our loyalty, we ask respectfully, why?\"                 * Newsmen in the church watched to see if the President was shaken. He showed no emotion.                 The minister went oi that \"we cannot close our Christian consciences to consideration of the rightness of actions as they are reported to                 us.\"                 t.He urged Americans to avoid the \"oversimplification 1hich views the war as a struggle against a monolithic communism.\"                 -West Berlin and Hong Kong are \"literally within the jaws of communism,\" he , but they \"are enjoying a.building boom.\"                 The communists are 40  from Helsinki, Vienna, Trieste-and yet these communities are less concerned about the threat thev offer than are Dallas, Phoenix and Seattle,\" the reacher said. \"The closer we get to the real Reds. the less we are intimidated by them,\" the minister said.                 WELCOME, THEN                 Mr. Johnson arrived here 'Saturday night after a tour of military bases and was met by Mrs. Johnson, daughter Lynda and her fiance. Marine Capt. Charles Robb. They attended services with 'the President and Mrs. Johnson.

Mr. Lewis noted that Mr. Johnson was sitting *here George Washington had sat, that the bible used for the reading of the  lessons was given to the church by King Henry VII of England, and that the bible rested on a lectern that was ,the gift of President Theodore Roosevelt.

After the services. Rev. Mr. Lewis was surrounded by newsmen who asked what his parishioners would think of a sermon that seemed to critici:e the President. He said \"It really doesn't matter.\"                 Rev. Mr. Lewis said he thinks people should follow Mr. Johnson.                 He put it this way:                 \"We would humbly ask questions of him but still we follow his leadership.\"                 Asked if it took fortitude                 to question Johnson so di- i rectly, the clergyman replied:                 \"Of course it did. One isn't privileged to tell the President of the United States what he thinks very often.\"                 Rev. Mr. Lewis is a native of Birmingham, Ala., and came to Williamsburg 10 years ago from Little Rock, Ark., where he was dean of Trinity Cathedral.                 Rev.

      "\t<FullText>PRESIDENT NIXON WILL SPEND TWO NIGHTS IN HAWAII AND ONE ON GUAM BEFORE ARRIVING IN PEKING SUNDAY                 Nixon                 leaves today on historic China trip                 There are signs in China that the cult of Mao's infallibility is being downgraded and Chou Enlai is now in command. Story, Page 2.                 Fro'n Wire Services                 WASHINGTON - President Nixon leaves Washington today on an historic 12-day trip to China to open \"a new chapter\" in relations with the world s most populous country.                 On the eve of his departure, Democrats joined Republicans in wishing the President well on his 20,395-mile round trip, to confer with Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai and other Chinese leaders.                 Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield told newsmen that Mr. Nixon's trip could mark the beginning of a peaceful evolution in Sino-                 American relations, replacing more than 20 years of open hostility.                 \"The door has been opened by his initiative,\" Mansfield said.                 Less than an hour before his scheduled departure today, Mr. Nixop will meet with bipartisan leaders of the Senate and House, including the Democratic chairmen and ranking Republicans on major committees.                 Mr. Nixon and his wife, Patricia,                 will leave the White House South Lawn by helicopter shortly after 10 a.m. after a sendoff from their daughters, Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower, members of the Cabinet, congressmen, and a thousand flagwaving  children. The event will be televised.                 Mr. Nixon will make brief remarks at the ceremony. The presidential jet leaves Andrews Air Force TRIP, Page 45                 President leaves for                 Peking today                 * TRIP                 Continued from Page 1                 Base, Md., at about 10:30 a.m, for a 10-hour nonstop flight to Hawaii, where Mr. Nixon will stay two nights readjusting to the time change before flying to Guam for an overnight stop.                 -He will land at Shanghai - and become the first American president ever to touch Chinese soil - at 9 a.m.. China time next Monday (8 p.m. EST Sunday.)                 After a Chinese navigator joins the crew of the \"Spirit of \"76,\" he will fly on to Peking where he will be officially welcomed by Chinese leaders at 11:40 a.m. China time (10:40 p.m., EST, Sunday).                 \"The postwar era with respect to the People's Republic of China and the United States - that chapter now comes to an end from the time I set foot on the soil of mainland China, and a new chapter begins,\" Mr. Nixon, told a news conference last week.                 The White House has not revealed much of Mr. Nixon's agenda for his fiveday stay in Peking and the one day each he will spend in the port cities of Hangchow and Shanghai. Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the schedule was kept flexible to permit unhindered conversations by Chinese and American leaders.                 Mr. Nixon will do some                 sightseeing, with planned visits to the Great Wall, the Ming tombs and the Forbidden City, the former home of China's emperors.                 Despite Mr. Nixon's careful efforts to caution the public not to expect too much, the trip begins in an atmosphere near euphoria. Although some Democrats have grumbled that the journey will give a tremendous boost to Mr. Nixon's re-election bid, there was a bipartisan hope for success.                 Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott said the opening of a dialogue with a nation of 800 million people was \"an earthshaking event.\"                 The House unanimously adopted a resolution prais.-                 ing Mr. Nixon for undertaking the trip and urging him to designate Sunday as a national day of prayer for world peace.                 Mr. Nixon spent Tuesday night and much of the day yesterday at his camp David retreat in Maryland, making last minute preparations.                 President and Mrs. Nixon will be accompanied by an official traveling party Of 13 persons, including White House aides, Asian experts and a speech writer. There are no senators or House members in the group.                 In addition to the official party, there will be other                 government officials, secretaries, communications technicians and newsmen in China for the visit. Ziegler said the total was \"not much more\" than 300.</FullText>\n",

      "\t<FullText>WHAT -HOW -WHY                 Logue's Challenge Gave                 White Biggest Boost                 By TIMOTHY LELAND                 liti-a IhandrW                 year ago this December Secretary of State Kevin White packed suitcase and took secret trip by himself to little island called Aruba 14 miles off the coast of Venezuela in the Netherlands Antilles                 KEVIN WHITE                 He was there a week, staying at the island s only hotel, taking long walks on the sun-drenched beach, thinking. And before he left, he had made up his mind.                 He had decided to put his political future on the line, to risk everything on one all-ornothing political gamble.                 He had decided to run for mayor of Boston.                 Tuesday, almost 12 months later to the day, White defeated Mrs. Louise Day Hicks by 12,429 votes in one of the nation s most closely watched municipal elections.                 The gamble had paid off. White is the mayor-elect of Boston.                 How did he do it? Why did he do it?                 Why did the highest-ranking Democrat in constitutional office want to make the move to City Hall?                 This is the anatomy of a campaign ...                 When White took his solitary journey to the island of Aruba that first week in December 1966, he knew he had come to a crossroad in his political career.                 The Democratic Party had just gone down to its worst defeat in 30 years. The Republicans had captured the top three constitutional offices in the state, plus the seat of former U.S. Sen. Leverett Saltonstall.                 John F. Kennedy once said the Democratic Party in Massachusetts would never improve until it had been brought to its knees. White knew his party was not on its knees - it was flat on its back.                 The Republican tidal wave had not washed away any of White's own statewide strength, however.                 WHITE Page 4                 Anatomy of a Campaign --Risked Career to Help Party                 WHITE                 Continued from Page 1                 For the fourth time in a row, White had been swept into office on a huge plurality - the  plurality, in fact. of anyone on either ticket that year.                 At 31, White had become the youngest Secretary of State in the history of the commonwealth, defeating Edward W. Brooke by 100,000.                 Two years later. in 1962, White topped the Democratic ticket, winning re-election by over half a million votes. And in 1964, earning his third term, he received the largest plurality ever given any candidate for Constitutional office. of either party, in the history of the state.                 But now it was 1966, the Democratic Party was . and White felt personally and politically  to make a move,                 As Secretary of State for                 six years, with four more ahead of him, he knew he stood a strong chance of dying from inactivity.                 Politically, the secretary of state s office is a dead end. lie knew he had to find a power base, and the mayor s office looked like the best bet.                 Furthermore, he felt stifled and frustrated in his present position. City Hall would provide a broader challenge, he reasoned, and a more satisfying one, personally.                 Finally, as one of the bright young men in the paty, lie felt he had an obligation to seek positions of responsibility, to help build it up, to bring his talents to hear on the problems of the day in a more forceful way than possible in the office of  .                 These are the factors that went into his decision to run for mayor.                 The week after he returned from Aruba, he                 called a meeting of his  advisers in the secondfloor living room of his Beacon Hill apartment, and told them of it.                 Present were Atty. Theodore Anzalone, 37, of East Boston, director of corporations in the secretary of state s office; Larry Cameron, 48, of Hyde Park, former law partner of White's and long-time friend; Richard Dray, 33, of Milton, general counsel in White's office; Edward T. Sullivan, 45, also of Milton, first deputy secretary of state; Joseph Twiss, 55, of Boston, second deputy and a shrewd political strategist; Richard Underwood, 30, of West Roxbury, third deputy director; and White's  brothers - Terry, 36, of Cohasset, and Brendan, 34, of West Roxbury.                 These men, along with one or two late starters, were to provide the backbone of White's campaign organization.                 It was pointed out by                 IN THE ELECTION Kevin White (wards in black) moved up from only one ward in the primary to 12 wards in his column in yesterday s election.                 IN THE SEPT. 26 PRIMARY, Wards 1 and 3 were won by Christopher A. Iannella; Wards 4, 5, 9 and 21 were in John W. Sears' column and Ward 12 went to Edward J. Logue.                 more than one at the meeting that White was taking a tremendous risk. If he went for mayor - and lost - it would probably mean the end of his political career. White knew this all too well. But his mind was made up.                 That very next. week, behind the scenes, White and his lieutenants began moving to line up financial and political support prior to his announcement - and ran into the first problem of the campaign:                 ANNOUNCES EARLY                 Few took his candidacy seriously.                 White, justifiably or not, had the reputation of being a vacillator. The people he contacted in these early days did not believe he really intended to run for mayor, and refused to commit themselves for this reason.                 White realized he had to do something to counter this impression.                 Originally he had planned to make his announcement in the Spring. The decision was made now, however, to move the date up to February.                 Thus, on Feb. 15, in a high-powered press conference at the Sheraton Plaza, White made it official,,emphasizing that his decision to run for mayor was \"irrevocable and unequivocal.\"                 The next problem he faced was how to build up a citywide campaign organization.                 State-wide, after four campaigns for constitutional office, White had an organization second to none. But on the ward and precinct level in Boston, he had to start virtually from scratch.                 White took two steps to put his campaign in motion.                 First, lie plunked a large portion of his available resources into a full-page advertisement, carried in the city s newspapers for one day. The ad asked for the names of persons willing to help - and it got a heartening response.                 Second, White began organizing a series of small neighborhood parties. In all, between the beginning of March and the end of June, (while most of the other would-be candidates were still sitting on their hands, or getting ready to announce), White held 75 of these parties, covering every ward in the city. He not only spoke at these parties, but he listened. And he began to get a real feeling for the frustrations and anxieties in Boston, which he termed, later in the campaign, \"a white Watts.\"                 Meanwhile, in a five-room suite on the eleventh floor of the Little Building, White's staff was researching the issues; preparing position papers, sending the candidate memos containing facts and figures about Boston and its needs.                 Information and points of view were also offered by several academic experts as well, including former New Frontiersmen Adam Yarmolinsky and Richard Goodwin, and the chairman of Harvard's government department, Samuel Huntington.                 By the first of July, White's campaign had gradually taken on form and momentum.                 In mid-August, however, it was jarred by a controversy that nearly caused White to drop out of the race.                 White's nomination papers wer\" challenged - on a technical discrepancy - by a person who later turned out to be a \"straw\" for Edward J. Logue.                 Logue eventually withdrew the challenge to White's papers, but for seven days, before the crisis was resolved. White was fighting for his political life.                 As it turned out, the challenge was probably the best thing that could have happened to White.                 BORROWED MONEY                 In the early part of Au. gust, White's private polls showed Logue coming on strong. Both Logue and Rep. John W. Sears had money to burn, while White was struggling to raise funds. In fact, during this very period, he was forced to take out a $25,000 loan of his own to keep the campaign afloat.                 To add to his problems, Time Magazine came out with an article on the Boston fight at the beginning of July that tagged White with being a \"bland\" candidate. The adjective caught on in Boston - and it hurt.                 All this was taking its toll on White's candidacy when the challenge of his papers came. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise.                 For White, the break came when he received an anonymous phone call, informing him that Logue was behind the challenge, formally brought by a \"mystery man\" by the name of Richard A. .                 Logue's blunder was in disassociating himself from the challenge. Asked by newsmen whether he knew , Logue said he did not think so, adding he was \"surprised\" White's papers had challenged and hoped he would stay on the ballot.                 At a subsequent news conference, by his own admission, it was brought out that Logue did indeed know  - that  had been in his own living room. And it became equally clear that, far from being \"surprised' by the challenge of White's papers, Logue himself was behind it.                 This single event virtually assured White's election in the primary.                 On the one hand, it put an abrupt end to the momentum of Logue's campaign drive. The affair seriously tarnished his veracity, and the former BRA administrator s candidacy all but collapsed.                 On the other hand, the battle over the nomination papers did much to dispel, for the time being, White's                 image of \"5.\" In the first real crisis of his political career, White proved he could be a tough fighter. He bucked the Establishment, and won.                 Following the Sept. 2l primary, in which he trailed Mrs. Louise Day Hicks by 13.222 votes. White had troubles of a different nature.                 Before the primary, White had stood alone, politically. After the primary, every big name in sight wanted to attach themselves to his candidacy.                 CALLED VOLPE OFF                 U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's endorsement came that night, unsolicited. And Gov. Volpe made similar sounds of endorsement on election night.                 Realizing he was in danger of being tagged the \"machine\" candidate, White called Volpe up on the phone and asked him, as a personal favor, to withdraw his implied endorsement. Volpe did a few days later at a press conference, noting that he would have no vote in the Boston election, being a resident of Winchester.                 The day after the primary, most of the political experts were predicting White would automatically pick up the votes of the other major candidates and win the final election easily.                 But they were wrong - and no one knew this better than White.                 The primary fight had been bitter, and had left serious divisions in the ranks of White's would-be supporters. He was faced with a major job of binding up the                 Ward by Ward Vote for Mayor                 (Includes Absentee Ballots)                 Vote in 1963                 WARD White Hicks Collins Piemonte                 1 ...............552 5851 4187 7993 2 ................2186 3204 2863 2520 3 .................3372 2657 2176 3976 4 ...............3766 1577 3500 2360 S..............6648 1983 5175 1740 6 ...............1873 5032 2976 3104 7 ...............2629 6290 4495 3756 S..............2069 1249 2106 1751 9 ...............2495 490 2140 1689 10 ..............2957 3077 3992 2497 11 ...............3243 2789 4177 2125 12 ..................5402 317 3461 2930 13 ...............3488 3823 4586 2930 14 ...............455 2407 5729 4700 j ..................2813 4016 4017 2531 16 ...............4935 6657 7082 3477 17 ..................4670 5702 6515 3419 18 ................108657 10272 10507 6512 19 ............** 4757 5427 6828 2009 20 ..................9668 9278 10675 5147 21 ...............6541 2813 5503 2371 22 ...............5365 4756 5934 2560 TOTALS ..3......102,551 90,122 108624 73067                 wounds and mobilizing his forces behind him.                 To this end, White had lunch with John Sears at the Tennis and Racquet Club, called Christopher  on the phone-and arranged to talk with key Logue workers in each of Logue's ward headquarters.                 The rest is recent memory.                 While did not win the election so much as Mrs. Hicks los! it.                 There was her pledge to raise police salaries to $10,000, her \"mystery trip\" to Washington, her long-distance squabble with U. S. Sen. John McClellan of Arkansas, her credibility gap.                 Finally, on Tuesday, White's billboard came true:                 \"Who will work to make your streets safe?\" they asked. And they answered: Kevin White will.\"</FullText>\n",

(UPI)                 Hotel,                 exhibit space lacking                 * COMPUTER                 Continued from Page 1 This one is big.                 Its organizers say they needed 8000 ffirst-class hotel rooms, a lot of exhibit space, lecture halls, meeting and conference rooms, and a supply of specialized display workers just to set up and take down the show.                 It will have drawn 25,000 visitors by the time it closes tonight, to see more than S100 million worth of sophisticated computer equipment that draws as much electric power as a small city.                 Most of the visitors are executives traveling on expense accounts. On the average they spend about $100 per day, and some of them have been here for as long                 as two weeks to set up exhibits.                 But they won t be back, because Boston hasn't got the facilities they need.                 The biggest problems according to show officials, are hotels and exhibit space.                 With the feverish help of the Champber of Commerce, convention officials could scrape up only 4500 of the required 8000 hotel rooms, some of them far from first class, and some as far away as Plymouth and Fall River,                 Exhibiting companies like to have \"hospitality suites\" to entertain prospects with well-stocked bars and buffets. About 150 were needed but only 53 were available, and  smaller than most companies would have liked.                 \"The hospitality suites are                 the smallest I've seen in a long time,\" said one executive whose company customarily spends more than $7500 in a week s entertainment, and may go as high as $10,000 in one day.                 In Boston, he says, they wouldn't be able to spend that much if they  couldn't get the customers into the room.                 Another executive, with no compunction about spending his company s money on hotel accommodations, is camping out in a room near the auditorium which is \"plain and simple dirty. The rugs and curtains are filthy, the walls grimy and a dreary, faded green.\"                 On the exhibit floor, space is scarce. One  a the War Memorial Auditorium is just about half the size needed.                 The space shortage forced conference organizers to turn down 127 companies that wanted to exhibit. Those who did get in found floor space rationed.                 Display men, the special carpenters and decorators who must set up the show, are in short supply in Boston. Companies ready to set up exhibits often had to wait up to a day for .                 Even the lease caused problems. The computer convention was scheduled to begin moving in five hours before a prior show ended. Somebody goofed.                 ELECTED                 Joseph N.
